							Whilst the majority of our customers gamble within their means for some it can be more difficult. In order to maintain control of your gambling habits we would like you to bear in mind the following points:
							<br />1) Gambling should be done in moderation and undertaken as a form of leisure not as a genuine way of making money
							<br />2) Avoid chasing losses
							<br />3) Only gamble when you can cover the losses
							<br />4) Keep track of the time and monitor the amount of money you spend
							<br />If you need to talk to someone about any concerns you may have with your gambling, please contact one of the organisations which we have detailed below.

						We accept bets for games, sporting and other events that are advertised on the Website(s) and/or through the Device(s) from time to time. All such bets are subject to the relevant House Betting Rules applicable to each event or game, and to these Terms and Conditions. If a manifest error or mistake occurs or an incorrect participant is quoted for any event, all bets placed on that event shall be void. In the event of any malfunction to the UWIN gaming system, failed transmission or other technical issues or suspected fraud UWIN reserves the right to void any and/or all bets placed.
						<br/><br/>Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms and Conditions, UWIN reserves the right, in our absolute discretion, to decline all, or part, of any bet placed without providing any reason whatsoever.
						<br/><br/>We only accept bets made through the internet and/or Devices in compliance with these Terms and Conditions. Bets are not accepted in any other form (whether by post, email, fax or otherwise) and where received will be void regardless of the outcome.
						<br/><br/>Subject to the other provisions herein, bets will be deemed to be validly placed by you if your username and password have been entered correctly, subject always to there being sufficient available funds in your account.
						<br/><br/>You are responsible and liable for all activities and transactions that take place through the use of any of the following (or any combination thereof):
						<br/><br/>your name;
						<br/><br/>your account number;

Subject to the other provisions herein, once your bets have been placed and their acceptance confirmed by us, they may not be cancelled, revoked or changed by you and shall be deemed to be conclusive evidence in respect of the bets that you have placed.
						<br/><br/>It should be noted that all bets are logged and recorded in the transaction log database. UWIN's transaction logs shall be conclusive evidence of all transactions and times at which the transactions are placed.

						<br/><br/>No betting is permitted after any deadline set by us, the commencement of an event and/or where the outcome of an event is known at the time of placement of your bet. If any event is erroneously left open for betting after the commencement of the event and/or where the outcome of an event is known, UWIN reserves the right to decline or void such bets placed without reference to you. Acceptance of any bet or any part thereof shall be at the sole discretion of UWIN. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause does not prohibit "in play" or "half time" bets where allowed by UWIN.

						<br/><br/>UWIN does not recognize suspended games, protests or overturned decisions for betting purposes.
						<br/><br/>Should you include a non-runner or void selection in a multiple bet, the bet will be settled on the remaining valid selections only.
						<br/><br/>You acknowledge that any and all odds, lines and handicaps are subject to fluctuation without notice, and the foregoing will become fixed only at the time of acceptance of the bet by us.
						<br/><br/>Where a manifest error, mistake or system failure deriving from UWIN results in an incorrect odd, line or handicap taken in a bet, the bet, or that part of the bet if it is a multiple bet/parlay sought to be placed with UWIN will be void. Provided the error, mistake or failure is rectified in time, UWIN may in our absolute discretion (but shall not be obliged to) make reasonable efforts to contact you to allow the choice of placing another bet at the correct odds, lines and handicaps.
						<br/><br/>We will not accept any simultaneously placed bets on one event from you.
						<br/><br/>In respect of any bet and the associated transactions therewith, the decision of UWIN is final and conclusive.
						<br/><br/>When the player wishes to place a bet using Indonesian Rupiah, the player shall place his bet by eliminating the last three (3) zeros from his desired stake. All bets shall be in multiples of one thousand. For easy reference, please see the following examples:
						<br/><br/>Once the player types the amount in accordance with the abovementioned rules, the system automatically recognizes that three (3) zeros shall be added to the amount of stake in order to determine the true amount of stake desired by the player.
						<br/><br/>Customers must register their bet request as individuals. Repeated requests containing the same selections from the same or different customers may be subsequently deemed where we believe the customers are acting in collusion or as part of a syndicate and/or identical or similar bet requests are registered within a short time of each other and dealt with us accordingly.

						<br/><br/>Round Length bet – one must determine whether the round will last for shorter or longer than the proposed time in minutes. Only the integer value of the minutes played is taken into account, that is, seconds are not taken into account.
						The handicap, individual total, and even/odd round total is shown in “deaths” unless the line specifies otherwise. A “death” shall mean the death of a character for any reason (killed by enemy characters, Roshan, creeps, etc.).

					<p class="m-b-3">
						Live bets are bets taken during an event and only for outcomes, the results of which are still undetermined. Live bets are offered in the special section “Live bets”
						<br/><br/>1. COEFFICIENT IN LIVE BETS
						The coefficient for events changes in real time. The coefficient can rise or fall in the period between the choice of the bet and its acceptance, which may influence the value of winnings. The coefficient for these bets changes gradually to reflect the development of events in the match
						<br/><br/>2. RESULTS FOR LIVE BETS
						The results of “Live” bets, on the basis of which bets are calculated, are the results that become known immediately after the end of the event. All subsequent changes will not be taken into account when deciding the proposed “Live” bets.
						<br/><br/>UWIN carries out the calculation of “Live” bets on the basis of its own statistical data on the actual course of the game. Unless otherwise stated, in “Live” bets all bets on athletes not participating in the competition shall be considered null and void. For outcomes, the results of which become known during the match, the calculation of bets, if possible, shall be carried out directly upon the completion of the event.
						<br/><br/>All bets the outcome of which was defined in “Live” mode (in particular, bets on who will win a certain segment of the match or whether the total will consist of “more”), shall be considered valid and are calculated even in the event that the tournament or event was interrupted.
						<br/><br/>Claims for bets made on a Live event shall be taken into consideration within 24 hours from the start of the event.
						If the match is interrupted or is not completed within 36 hours, the bets calculated up to this moment shall not be subject to recalculation. For outcomes, the results of which are not clearly defined, which have not taken place and/or have not been fully completed, the coefficient of winnings on bets shall be equal to “1” (return of bet).
